<font face="Palatino Linotype">Languages, like the cultures that sing, speak, 
and write them, change continually.&nbsp; When we attempt to define the forms, 
the diction, the structure, or the pronunciation, of a language no longer 
spoken, all we can aspire to achieve is reasonable approximation.&nbsp; The 
history of the Greek language is well attested, in some respects, by the 
abundant documents that have survived, and yet there are innumerable gray areas 
that make all our labels relative.&nbsp; How to define precisely the temporal 
boundaries or the features of ancient Greek or those of <i>koinê </i>Greek<i>?</i>&nbsp; 
The best answer&nbsp; to this complex question is simplistic but practical.&nbsp; 
We should follow the tradition adopted in linguistics, history, history of 
religion, academic use, and so forth, and be tolerant of inaccuracies. </font>

<font face="Palatino Linotype">The language spoken by the migrants who in&nbsp; 
prehistoric times settled in the territory that we call &quot;Greece&quot; but did not 
become Greece until many centuries later, is generally called &quot;ancient Greek.&quot;&nbsp; 
We happen to have a later witness of one of the variants of the Greek of those 
early periods,&nbsp; the Ionic dialect. This witness is the version of the 
Homeric songs that fixed a long and fluid oral tradition. The language of the <i>
Iliad </i>and the <i>Odyssey&nbsp;</i> is&nbsp; Ionic but it has traces of other 
dialects as well.&nbsp; Other similar examples could illustrate this fundamental 
trait of Greek: it was comprised of a multitude of dialects, which developed 
both in their own right and by merging with other dialects... what we call 
ancient Greek was itself a common (<i>koinê</i>) language. </font></p>

<font face="Palatino Linotype">On account of the political, military, and 
cultural&nbsp; predominance of the city of Athens (in the region known as 
Attica), by the fifth century BCE, a further&nbsp; merging of Greek dialects 
resulted into what is generally known as <i>classical Greek</i>.&nbsp; Once 
more, this language represents basically the Attic dialect, but it is also a 
&quot;common&quot; result of cultural blending.&nbsp; Learning classical Greek is 
synonymous with learning Attic.&nbsp; Other dialects, to some degree 
artificially preserved in various literary genres, are studied only by linguists 
and classicists who wish to read lyric and epic poetry and the history of 
Herodotus as well as the Attic prose of Plato, Demosthenes, or Aristotle. </font></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font face="Palatino Linotype">In Hellenistic times a new linguistic blending 
occurred, prompted by the political and cultural unification that resulted from 
Alexander's conquests.&nbsp; This is Hellenistic Greek, the <i>common (koin</i></font><i><font face="Palatino Linotype">ê</font></i><font face="Palatino Linotype"><i>) 
Greek</i><b> </b></font><font face="Palatino Linotype">of the Septuagint and the 
New Testament, i.e. <i>Biblical Greek</i>.&nbsp; How colloquial some of these 
texts are is an issue that scholars have discovered and debated in recent times.&nbsp; 
What no one disputes is that, even though Alexander was Macedonian, his own 
dialect was a small ingredient of <i>koinê<b>, </b></i>where, once again, 
because of the cultural (if no longer political) dominance of Athens it was the 
Attic dialect that prevailed. </font></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font face="Palatino Linotype">This does not mean, of course, that the features 
of Attic Greek remained constant in&nbsp; <i>koinê </i>Greek.&nbsp; How could 
they?&nbsp; Languages, I said above, change continually. Yet there are enough 
shared features to make the study of Attic, i.e., classical or ancient Greek, a 
solid foundation for the study of Biblical or <i>koinê </i>Greek.&nbsp; This is 
particularly true in an elementary course such as this one.&nbsp; As we move on 
through grammar and idiom, I will point out some important differences between 
the two periods of the Greek language. </font></p>
